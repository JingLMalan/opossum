When things start failing, opossum plays dead and fails fast. If you want, you can provide a fallback function to be executed when in the failure state. For more about the circuit breaker pattern, there are lots of resources on the web - search it! Fowler's blog post is one place to start reading. Project Info License: Apache-2.0 Build: make Documentation: https://nodeshift.github.io/opossum/ Typngs: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/opossum Issue tracker: https://github.com/nodeshift/opossum/issues Engines: Node.js 8.x, 10.x, 11.x UsageLet's say you've got an API that depends on something that might fail - a network operation, or disk read, for example. Wrap those functions up in a CircuitBreaker and you have control over your destiny. const circuitBreaker = require('opossum'); function asyncFunctionThatCouldFail (x, y) { return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; { // Do something, maybe on the network or a disk }); } const options = { timeout: 3000, // If our function takes longer than 3 seconds, trigger a failure errorThresholdPercentage: 50, // When 50% of requests fail, trip the circuit resetTimeout: 30000 // After 30 seconds, try again. }; const breaker = circuitBreaker(asyncFunctionThatCouldFail, options); breaker.fire(params) .then(console.log) .catch(console.error);FallbackYou can also provide a fallback function that will be executed in the event of failure. To take some action when the fallback is performed, listen for the fallback event. const breaker = circuitBreaker(asyncFunctionThatCouldFail, options); // if asyncFunctionThatCouldFail starts to fail, firing the breaker // will trigger our fallback function breaker.fallback(() =&gt; 'Sorry, out of service right now'); breaker.on('fallback', (result) =&gt; reportFallbackEvent(result));Once the circuit has opened, a timeout is set based on options.resetTimeout. When the resetTimeout expires, opossum will enter the halfOpen state. Once in the halfOpen state, the next time the circuit is fired, the circuit's action will be executed again. If successful, the circuit will close and emit the close event. If the action fails or times out, it immediately re-enters the open state. When a fallback function is triggered, it's considered a failure, and the fallback function will continue to be executed until the breaker is closed. BrowserOpossum really shines in a browser. You can use it to guard against network failures in your AJAX calls. We recommend using webpack to bundle your applications, since it does not have the effect of polluting the window object with a global. However, if you need it, you can access a circuitBreaker function in the global namespace by doing something similar to what is shown in the below example. Here is an example using hapi.js. See the examples folder for more detail. Include opossum.js in your HTML file. &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;My Super App&lt;/title&gt; &lt;script type='text/javascript' src=\"/jquery.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script type='text/javascript' src=\"/opossum.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script type='text/javascript' src=\"/app.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;body&gt; ... &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;/html&gt;In your application, set a route to the file, pointing to node_modules/opossum/dist/opossum-min.js. // server.js const server = new Hapi.Server(); server.register(require('inert', (err) =&gt; possibleError(err))); server.route({ method: 'GET', path: '/opossum.js', handler: { file: { path: path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'opossum', 'dist', 'opossum-min.js'), } } });In the browser's global scope will be a circuitBreaker function. Use it to create circuit breakers, guarding against network failures in your REST API calls. // app.js const route = 'https://example-service.com/rest/route'; const circuitBreakerOptions = { timeout: 500, maxFailures: 3, resetTimeout: 5000 }; const circuit = circuitBreaker(() =&gt; $.get(route), circuitBreakerOptions); circuit.fallback(() =&gt; `${route} unavailable right now. Try later.`)); circuit.on('success', (result) =&gt; $(element).append(JSON.stringify(result)})); $(() =&gt; { $('#serviceButton').click(() =&gt; circuit.fire().catch((e) =&gt; console.error(e))); }); EventsA CircuitBreaker will emit events for important things that occur. Here are the events you can listen for. fire - emitted when the breaker is fired. reject - emitted when the breaker is open (or halfOpen). timeout - emitted when the breaker action times out. success - emitted when the breaker action completes successfully failure - emitted when the breaker action fails, called with the error open - emitted when the breaker state changes to open close - emitted when the breaker state changes to closed halfOpen - emitted when the breaker state changes to halfOpen fallback - emitted when the breaker has a fallback function and executes it semaphore-locked - emitted when the breaker is at capacity and cannot execute the request health-check-failed - emitted when a user-supplied health check function returns a rejected promise Handling events gives a greater level of control over your application behavior. const circuit = circuitBreaker(() =&gt; $.get(route), circuitBreakerOptions); circuit.fallback(() =&gt; ({ body: `${route} unavailable right now. Try later.` })); circuit.on('success', (result) =&gt; $(element).append( makeNode(`SUCCESS: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`))); circuit.on('timeout', () =&gt; $(element).append( makeNode(`TIMEOUT: ${route} is taking too long to respond.`))); circuit.on('reject', () =&gt; $(element).append( makeNode(`REJECTED: The breaker for ${route} is open. Failing fast.`))); circuit.on('open', () =&gt; $(element).append( makeNode(`OPEN: The breaker for ${route} just opened.`))); circuit.on('halfOpen', () =&gt; $(element).append( makeNode(`HALF_OPEN: The breaker for ${route} is half open.`))); circuit.on('close', () =&gt; $(element).append( makeNode(`CLOSE: The breaker for ${route} has closed. Service OK.`))); circuit.on('fallback', (data) =&gt; $(element).append( makeNode(`FALLBACK: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`)));Promises vs. CallbacksThe opossum API returns a Promise from CircuitBreaker.fire(). But your circuit action - the async function that might fail - doesn't have to return a promise. You can easily turn Node.js style callback functions into something opossum understands by using circuitBreaker.promisify(). const fs = require('fs'); const circuitBreaker = require('opossum'); const readFile = circuitBreaker.promisify(fs.readFile); const breaker = circuitBreaker(readFile, options); breaker.fire('./package.json', 'utf-8') .then(console.log) .catch(console.error);And just for fun, your circuit doesn't even really have to be a function. Not sure when you'd use this - but you could if you wanted to. const breaker = circuitBreaker('foo', options); breaker.fire() .then(console.log) // logs 'foo' .catch(console.error);TypingsTypings are available here. If you'd like to add them, run npm install @types/opossum in your project. Hystrix MetricsA Hystrix Stream is available for use with a Hystrix Dashboard using the circuitBreaker.hystrixStats.getHystrixStream method. This method returns a Node.js Stream, which makes it easy to create an SSE stream that will be compliant with a Hystrix Dashboard. Additional Reading: Hystrix Metrics Event Stream, Turbine, Hystrix Dashboard TroubleshootingYou may run into issues related to too many listeners on an EventEmitter like this. (node:25619) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 10 unpipe listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit (node:25619) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 drain listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit (node:25619) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 error listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit (node:25619) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 close listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit (node:25619) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 finish listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limitThis typically occurs when you have created more than ten CircuitBreaker instances. This is due to the fact that every circuit created is adding a listener to the stream accessed via circuit.stats.getHystrixStream(), and the default EventEmitter listener limit is 10. In some cases, seeing this error might indicate a bug in client code, where many CircuitBreakers are inadvertently being created. But there are legitimate scenarios where this may not be the case. For example, it could just be that you need more than 10 CircuitBreakers in your app. That's ok. To get around the error, you can set the number of listeners on the stream. circuit.stats.getHystrixStream().setMaxListeners(100);Or it could be that you have a large test suite which exercises some code that creates CircuitBreakers and does so repeatedly. If the CircuitBreaker being created is only needed for the duration of the test, use circuit.shutdown() when the circuit is no longer in use to clean up all listeners. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2019-02-25T17:17:44-05:00 using the DocStrap template.

Parameters: Name Type Description action function The action to fire for this CircuitBreaker options Object Options for the CircuitBreaker. There are **no default options** when you use the constructor directly. You must supply values for each of these. Properties Name Type Description timeout Number The time in milliseconds that action should be allowed to execute before timing out. Timeout can be disabled by setting this to `false`. maxFailures Number The number of times the circuit can fail before opening. (deprecated - see {CircuitBreaker#options.errorThresholdPercentage}) resetTimeout Number The time in milliseconds to wait before setting the breaker to `halfOpen` state, and trying the action again. rollingCountTimeout Number Sets the duration of the statistical rolling window, in milliseconds. This is how long Opossum keeps metrics for the circuit breaker to use and for publishing. Default: 10000 rollingCountBuckets Number sets the number of buckets the rolling statistical window is divided into. So, if options.rollingCountTimeout is 10000, and options.rollingCountBuckets is 10, then the statistical window will be 1000 1 second snapshots in the statistical window. Default: 10 name String the circuit name to use when reporting stats rollingPercentilesEnabled Boolean This property indicates whether execution latencies should be tracked and calculated as percentiles. If they are disabled, all summary statistics (mean, percentiles) are returned as -1. capacity Number the number of concurrent requests allowed. If the number currently executing function calls is equal to options.capacity, further calls to `fire()` are rejected until at least one of the current requests completes. errorThresholdPercentage Number the error percentage at which to open the circuit and start short-circuiting requests to fallback. enabled boolean whether this circuit is enabled upon construction. Default: true allowWarmUp boolean determines whether to allow failures without opening the circuit during a brief warmup period (this is the `rollingCountDuration` property). Default: false allow before enabling the circuit. This can help in situations where no matter what your `errorThresholdPercentage` is, if the first execution times out or fails, the circuit immediately opens. Default: 0 volumeThreshold Number the minimum number of requests within the rolling statistical window that must exist before the circuit breaker can open. This is similar to `options.allowWarmUp` in that no matter how many failures there are, if the number of requests within the statistical window does not exceed this threshold, the circuit will remain closed. Default: 0 Extends EventEmitter Members closed True if the circuit is currently closed. False otherwise. halfOpen True if the circuit is currently half opened. False otherwise. hystrixStats A convenience function that returns the hystrixStats. isShutdown Determines if the circuit has been shutdown. name Gets the name of this circuit opened True if the circuit is currently opened. False otherwise. stats A convenience function that returns the current stats for the circuit. See: Status#stats status The current Status of this CircuitBreaker Methods clearCache() Clears the cache of this CircuitBreaker close() Closes the breaker, allowing the action to execute again Fires: CircuitBreaker#event:close disable() Disables this circuit, causing all calls to the circuit's function to be executed without circuit or fallback protection. enable() Enables this circuit. If the circuit is the disabled state, it will be re-enabled. If not, this is essentially a noop. fallback(func) Provide a fallback function for this CircuitBreaker. This function will be executed when the circuit is `fire`d and fails. It will always be preceded by a `failure` event, and `breaker.fire` returns a rejected Promise. Parameters: Name Type Description func function | CircuitBreaker the fallback function to execute when the breaker has opened or when a timeout or error occurs. Returns: CircuitBreaker this fire() Execute the action for this circuit. If the action fails or times out, the returned promise will be rejected. If the action succeeds, the promise will resolve with the resolved value from action. If a fallback function was provided, it will be invoked in the event of any failure or timeout. Fires: CircuitBreaker#event:failure CircuitBreaker#event:fallback CircuitBreaker#event:fire CircuitBreaker#event:reject CircuitBreaker#event:success CircuitBreaker#event:timeout CircuitBreaker#event:semaphore-locked Returns: a Promise which resolves on success and is rejected on failure of the action. healthCheck(func [, interval]) Provide a health check function to be called periodically. The function should return a Promise. If the promise is rejected the circuit will open. This is in addition to the existing circuit behavior as defined by `options.errorThresholdPercentage` in the constructor. For example, if the health check function provided here always returns a resolved promise, the circuit can still trip and open if there are failures exceeding the configured threshold. The health check function is executed within the circuit breaker's execution context, so `this` within the function is the circuit breaker itself. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description func function a health check function which returns a promise. interval Number &lt;optional&gt; the amount of time between calls to the health check function. Default: 5000 (5 seconds) Fires: CircuitBreaker#event:health-check-failed Throws: TypeError if `interval` is supplied but not a number Returns: Type Promise open() Opens the breaker. Each time the breaker is fired while the circuit is opened, a failed Promise is returned, or if any fallback function has been provided, it is invoked. Fires: CircuitBreaker#event:open shutdown() Shuts down this circuit breaker. All subsequent calls to the circuit will fail, returning a rejected promise.

If that attempt is successful, the circuit will be closed. Otherwise it remains open. health-check-failed Emitted with the user-supplied health check function returns a rejected promise. open Emitted when the breaker opens because the action has failed more than `options.maxFailures` number of times. reject Emitted when the circuit breaker is open and failing fast semaphore-locked Emitted when the rate limit has been reached and there are no more locks to be obtained. success Emitted when the circuit breaker action succeeds timeout Emitted when the circuit breaker action takes longer than `options.timeout` × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2019-02-25T17:17:44-05:00 using the DocStrap template.
